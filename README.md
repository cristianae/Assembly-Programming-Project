# Assembly-Programming-Project
An assembly program that converts two-digit octal input to decimal and displays it only if it's a multiple of 3 or 5.

# Description:
This project involved writing an assembly language program that converts a two-digit octal number (entered by the user) into its decimal equivalent. The program then displays the result only if the decimal number is a multiple of 3 or 5; otherwise, it outputs 0. This was completed as part of my Computer Organization project.

# Built with:
Custom Assembly Language
Assembler.jar simulator

# How to run the code:
- Download and open Assembler.jar
- Clone the repository
- Navigate into the src folder → 'cd src'
- Load Assembly_language_program.txt in the Source Program panel.
- Compile the code: Tools → Compile.
- Enter an octal number in the Input Stream.
- Run the program via Tools → Execute → Run and take a look at the output.

# Example:
Input: 43 (octal)
Decimal: 35 → Output: 35
Input: 10 (octal)
Decimal: 8 → Not a multiple → Output: 0
